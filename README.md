Business Health Assistant The Business Health Assistant 
is an intelligent chatbot developed as the final mini project for the Generative AI course by **Limitless Learning (LL)**. 
This assistant provides business diagnostics based on expert-written resources and leverages powerful AI tools for semantic search and natural language understanding. 

## Project Description
This chatbot assists users in diagnosing business issues and exploring management solutions by understanding their questions and retrieving the most relevant information from a curated knowledge base. 
It uses: 

- **Generative AI (Gemini Pro)** to generate insightful responses
- **Semantic search with FAISS and Sentence Transformers** to find relevant context
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** from the book _"Diagnosis of Business"_ by **Monica Violeta Achim**
  
##  Technologies Used
- Python 3.10+
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for UI framework
- [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for Vector similarity search - [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/)
- Text embeddings - [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev) as Language model API

## How to Run the App
1. Clone this repository:
   
       gh repo clone RahimCHELLAL/BusinessDiagnosisBot
       cd business-health-assistant
  
3. Install the required dependencies:
   
       pip install -r requirements.txt
  
5. Add your Gemini API key to a .env file:
   
       GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
7. Launch the Streamlit app:
   
     streamlit run app.py
   
How It Works The app reads and chunks the business diagnosis text. Each chunk is embedded using Sentence Transformers. 
A FAISS index is built for fast similarity search. When a user enters a query, the system retrieves semantically similar chunks and uses Gemini to generate a response using that context.  


Easter Eggs  Commander Guido might occasionally interrupt with drone-based wisdom, saying things like "Shoganai", "Chi ku", or "Sim extamante", and might joke about attaching flamethrowers to drones.  
Dr. Jo√£o may offer Stoic insights and strategic reflections inspired by his love for theory, mobile robots, and Europa Universalis.
