      "Okay, based on the provided context, here's a breakdown of how to approach diagnosing your retail business's declining performance, and where to focus your efforts. The context emphasizes a broad, multi-faceted diagnosis, not just a financial one.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Understanding the Diagnostic Approach (Based on the Context)**\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided text defines business diagnosis as a \"broad investigation of the main aspects of the organization activity, of economic, technical, sociological, legal and managerial nature.\" This means you need to look beyond just the numbers. It's about understanding *why* things are happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Applying the Diagnostic Framework to Your Situation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down your issues and apply the different areas mentioned in the context:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Economic:** This is where your sales decline directly falls. However, it's not just about the sales numbers themselves. You need to investigate:\n",
      "    *   **Market Trends:** Is there a broader shift in consumer behavior affecting your product category? Are competitors offering something more appealing?\n",
      "    *   **Pricing:** Are your prices competitive? Have you adjusted them recently?\n",
      "    *   **Seasonality:** Is this decline consistent with seasonal patterns?\n",
      "*   **Technical:** This relates to your operations and technology.\n",
      "    *   **Online Ads:** You've already identified this as a problem.  Dig deeper:\n",
      "        *   **Targeting:** Are you reaching the right audience?\n",
      "        *   **Ad Creative:** Are your ads compelling?\n",
      "        *   **Landing Page:** Does your website/landing page convert visitors into customers?\n",
      "    *   **Inventory Management:** Slow-moving inventory suggests issues.\n",
      "        *   **Purchasing Decisions:** Are you buying the right products?\n",
      "        *   **Storage/Display:** Is your inventory presented attractively?\n",
      "*   **Sociological:** This considers your customers and their behavior.\n",
      "    *   **Fewer Customers:** This is a key symptom. Why?\n",
      "        *   **Customer Feedback:** Have you asked your existing customers why they're still shopping with you?  Have you lost customers and if so, why?\n",
      "        *   **Changing Demographics:** Has the makeup of your customer base changed?\n",
      "        *   **Customer Service:** Is your customer service still excellent?\n",
      "*   **Legal:** Less likely to be the primary driver, but worth a quick check.\n",
      "    *   **Regulations:** Are there any new regulations impacting your business?\n",
      "*   **Managerial:** This focuses on your leadership and internal processes.\n",
      "    *   **Staff Training:** Are your employees adequately trained and motivated?\n",
      "    *   **Marketing Strategy:** Is your overall marketing strategy effective?\n",
      "    *   **Decision-Making:** Are you making data-driven decisions?\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Suggested Focus Areas (Prioritized)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your description, here's where I'd suggest you focus your diagnostic efforts *first*:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Customer Analysis (Sociological):**  *Immediately* start gathering customer feedback. Talk to existing customers, try to reconnect with lost customers (if possible), and analyze any available customer data. Understanding *why* you're seeing fewer customers is paramount.\n",
      "2.  **Online Advertising (Technical):**  A deep dive into your online ad performance is crucial.  Review targeting, ad creative, and landing page effectiveness. Consider A/B testing different ad variations.\n",
      "3.  **Inventory Management (Technical & Economic):** Analyze your inventory turnover rates. Identify slow-moving items and consider markdowns, promotions, or discontinuing them.  Review your purchasing decisions to ensure you're buying what customers want.\n",
      "4.  **Market Research (Economic):** Research your competitors and the broader market trends to see if there are external factors impacting your business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:** The context emphasizes a *broad* investigation. Don't get bogged down in just one area.  The goal is to identify the *root causes* of your declining sales, which may involve a combination of factors across these different areas.\n"
